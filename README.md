- About this project :

I've completed a shopping website developed using React, ensuring a dynamic and seamless user experience. The website is styled with Tailwind CSS, making it fully responsive and visually appealing on both mobile and desktop devices. For managing state and data, I utilized Context API, which allowed for an efficient and scalable data flow throughout the application. This project has been an excellent opportunity to refine my front-end development skills and integrate modern tools for creating a user-friendly interface across all devices.
